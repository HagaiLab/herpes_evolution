# Functional and structural determinants of long- and short-term evolution of herpesvirus proteins

This gitHub includes a collection of scripts and command-lines for running and reproducing the analysis workflow.

## Description

This repository contains code for data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization. It includes:

- **Command-lines for programs used in this study including flags and parameters used:
GUIDANCE2, GARD, SLAC, FEL, PhyML, AlphaFold, CSU, PICNIC, TM-Align.

- **Deatiled scripts for running complete analyses:
1) Identification of Domain-Motif Interactions within host-virus protein-protein interactions data.
2) Analysis of motif conservation across viral phylogenies (four scripts).
3) Condensate analysis: (i) dN/dS and disorder percent in viral proteins that are part of condensates versus other viral proteins; (ii) linear model to assess the relationship between different features (viral protein conservation, disorder fraction, condensate formation). 
4) Contact order calculation (as a measure for fold complexity).
